    {name: "an enthusiastic frontend developer", description: "During my studies, I was forced to quickly learn the basics of React for a project from one of the courses, which I managed to achieve in less than a week. This is how my adventure with JS-based frameworks for creating web applications began.  Soon after, in the summer of 2021, I took on my first job, where this time I had to  quickly assimilate the basics of programming in Vue, which I also accomplished at a  swift pace and despite a few setbacks in the first weeks of work, after a few months I  became one of the most valuable employees of the company.  After less than a year, I received a job offer for a European Union project at the  University of Warsaw, which I of course accepted. At UW, I continued to polish my  proficiency in Vue as well as pure JS, HTML, CSS and even in the field of UI/UX design,  as I was responsible for both designing and implementing the user interface."},
